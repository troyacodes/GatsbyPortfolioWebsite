            <p>
              I am a Toronto-based full-stack web developer. Like a lot of
              people, the majority of my skills have been self taught. Back in
              2013, while in highschool, I began teaching myself the basics of
              web design starting with HTML, CSS, and PHP. Upon graduation I
              started post-secondary at George Brown College and received a
              diploma in Computer Programming. While in college I started my
              freelance business called Six Side Media, mainly focusing on
              creating WordPress and Shopify websites but also graphic design.
              Picking up graphic design skills have helped me to this day,
              custom logos and graphics can be seen in all of my projects. More
              recently, I've shifted my focus to full-stack web development,
              learning modern practices and javascript frameworks such as
              Node.js and React. I always enjoy learning new things, building
              useful applications, working with people, and solving real-world
              problems for real-world stakeholders.

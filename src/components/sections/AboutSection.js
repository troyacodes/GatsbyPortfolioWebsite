            <p>
              I am a Toronto-based front end developer. Like a lot of people,
              the majority of my skills have been self taught. I started with
              HTML, CSS, and PHP in 2013 while in high school, messing around
              with frameworks like CodeIgniter and Bootstrap. Upon graduation I
              started post-secondary at George Brown College and received a
              diploma in Computer Programming. While in college I started my
              freelance business called Six Side Media, mainly focusing on
              WordPress and graphic design. Recently, I've shifted my focus to
              front end development, learning modern front end practices and
              frameworks. I enjoy learning new things, building applications,
              working with people, and solving real-world problems for
              real-world stakeholders.
